# Image Processing Project

TODOs:
- ~~Add a "Reset to Grayscale" button.~~
- ~~Show Encoded data (whatever noise it may be) in place of the image when we hit "Encode".~~ (Kind of done)
        - Revise all algorithms such that they return data in the same format so no problems occur.
- ~~Add an Entropy Coder to Predictive Coding (just attach Huffman, RLE, ...etc).~~ (Added RLE)
- ~~Add more parameters to Binary Thresholding.~~ (Added Max Value, dunno what else to add)
- Fix Arithmetic Coding. It's slow and compression ratio is incorrectly calculated.
- Revise Bit-Plane Coding (compression ratio is always 0.12:1).
- Revise Wavelet Coding (compression ratio is always 0.25:1).
