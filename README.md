# Image Processing Project

TODOs:
- ~~Add a "Reset to Grayscale" button.~~
- Show Encoded data (whatever noise it may be) in place of the image when we hit "Encode".
        - Revise all algorithms such that they return data in the same format so no problems occur.
- Add an Entropy Coder to Predictive Coding (just attach Huffman, RLE, ...etc).
- Add more parameters to Binary Thresholding.
- Fix Arithmetic Coding. It causes crashes and when it worked it erased the image.
- Revise Bit-Plane Coding (compression ratio is always 0.12:1).
- Revise Wavelet Coding (compression ratio is always 0.25:1).
